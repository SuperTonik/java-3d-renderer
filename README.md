# java-3d-renderer
Simple Java 3D renderer using LWJGL.

Uploaded from the archives. This has been written long time ago when LWJGL 2 was still a thing. 
I hold no responsibility for this code even though it was me who wrote it.

This is an OPENGL 3D renderer written in Java. The program includes simple shaders and you can rotate and 
move the rendered objects. Pretty basic stuff.
